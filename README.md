# Finetune-Distill-Quantize-ORT
The aim of this project is to transform a large, general-purpose model into a fast, compact, and highly accurate version, optimized for low latency and suitable for edge computing. This involves fine-tuning the model, applying model distillation, quantization, and leveraging ONNX Runtime (ORT) for efficient inference.
