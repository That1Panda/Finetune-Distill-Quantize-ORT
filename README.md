# Finetune-Distill-Quantize-ORT

This project focuses on transforming a large, general-purpose machine learning model into a compact, highly accurate, and efficient version suitable for low-latency deployment on edge devices. The process involves:

1. **Fine-tuning** the model to improve its performance on a specific task.
2. **Model distillation** to create a smaller, more efficient student model that mimics the performance of a larger teacher model.
3. **Quantization** to reduce the model's size and improve inference speed without significant loss in accuracy.
4. **ONNX Runtime (ORT)** for further optimization, enabling efficient inference on a wide range of hardware.

## Project Structure

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks to guide you through the model optimization process:

1. **`finetuning.ipynb`**: This notebook walks through the steps of fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a specific task. The fine-tuning process allows the model to adapt to the taskâ€™s requirements and optimize its performance.

2. **`distill_quantize_ort.ipynb`**: In this notebook, we focus on:
   - **Distillation**: Training a smaller student model based on the outputs of the fine-tuned model (the teacher).
   - **Quantization**: Reducing the precision of the model's weights and activations to minimize memory usage and increase inference speed.
   - **ONNX Runtime (ORT)**: Converting the model into the ONNX format and utilizing ORT for optimized and low-latency inference.

## Performance Evaluation

We will compare models across three key factors:

1. **Performance**: How well does the model perform on the target task?
2. **Latency**: How fast is inference, particularly on edge devices?
3. **Model Size**: What is the reduction in model size after each step (distillation, quantization, and ORT)?

The results from each phase will be summarized and visualized to demonstrate the trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and model size.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

All necessary libraries are inside each notebook so that you can use the notebooks inside `Colab` or `Kaggle` 


### Running the Notebooks

1. Open `finetuning.ipynb` to fine-tune the model on your specific task.
2. After fine-tuning, proceed to `distill_quantize_ort.ipynb` to distill the model, apply quantization, and optimize it with ONNX Runtime.

## Results

By the end of this project, you will have a highly efficient and optimized model, suitable for deployment in environments with limited computational resources while maintaining competitive performance on the given task.
